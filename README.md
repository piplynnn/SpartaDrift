# SpartaDrift

SpartaDrift challenges players to avoid obstacles while driving on an endless road. The players are given several different ways to play the game by playing the game slow and steady, utilizing speed boosts, or a combination of both. The speed boosts increase the car's speed and will increase the number of points you receive per time interval. However, this comes with added difficulty and may or may not be successful for the player.
